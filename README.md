# Linear-Regression-Fundamentals for finance

This repository explores linear regression models applied to the field of finance. The primary goal is to build financial models from scratch, focusing on their mathematical foundations, without relying on machine learning libraries or pre-built functions for model fitting. By doing so, we aim to deepen our understanding of how these models work and their practical applications in predicting financial returns.

## Overview

The repository will cover two key projects:

- Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

The CAPM is a single-factor linear regression model that predicts the returns of a given asset based on the returns of a market or benchmark during the same period. It is widely used in finance to estimate the relationship between risk and return, helping investors make informed decisions.

- Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)

The APT extends the CAPM by incorporating multiple factors or variables into the regression model. It retains a similar principle to the CAPM but relaxes some of its assumptions, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of asset returns by considering macroeconomic or company-specific factors.

## Next Steps

The series will begin with the CAPM model, where we will:

- Retrieve real-world financial data (e.g., stock prices, market indices) using APIs like Alpha Vantage
- Preprocess and transform the data for analysis
- Implement the CAPM from scratch

  
In the following project, we will extend these concepts to the APT model, incorporating multiple factors into the regression framework.
